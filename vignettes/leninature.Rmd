The Marxists Internet Archive has an extensive collection of Lenin's works,
ranging from books like [What Is To Be Done?](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/index.htm) to
[notes scribbled on printed documents](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1912/nov/00sd.htm).
This package makes these works available in a (mostly) tidy data frame, `lenin`.

The works span from 1893 to 1923 (Lenin died in early 1924), although the
majority of his writing is from the founding of the Bolshevik party (1903) and
on-wards. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the year of the February and October
Revolutions were marked by a particular flurry of writing.

```{r annotate_works_of_interest}

select_works <- data.frame(
  abbrev = c(
    "witbd", 
    "staterev", 
    "mec"
  ),

    "What\nis to be\ndone?",
    "State\n&\nRev",
    "Materialism &\nEmpirio criticism"
  )
)

    year = as.numeric(year),
  ) %>%
  group_by(name, abbrev, year) %>%
  summarize(words = sum(nw)/1000)

## Books
Lenin's longest work is "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism", a philosophical 
text arguing against Mach and other idealists who claim the world had no
objective real existence outside human perception. It's over three times as
long as his perhaps more famous "The State and Revolution", in which he argues
for the need to remove the old institutions of the bourgeois state through
revolution in order to bring about a social structure without class.
```{r }
lenin %>%
  mutate(nw = str_count(text, "\\S+")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(title)) %>%
  group_by(year, title) %>% 
  summarize(`number of words` = sum(nw)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(`number of words`)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  knitr::kable()

```
## Letters

The Marxists Internet Archive's collection also includes an extensive number of
letters from Lenin to friends and colleagues. His most frequent correspondents
included his mother and early Bolsheviks Zinoviev, Kamenev, Gorbunov, and
Armand.

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=3}


letter_parts <- c( "closing", "salutation")

letters <- lenin %>%
  group_by(url) %>%
  filter(
    sum(text_annotation %in% letter_parts) > 0 || 
      grepl("To:", title) ||
      title == "Addressee Unidentified"
    )

letters %>%
  mutate(addressee = trimws(gsub("To:", "", title))) %>%
  select(url, addressee) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(addressee) %>%
  tally() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = n, y = reorder(addressee, n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = addressee)) +
  geom_label(
    aes(x = 0, label = addressee),
    fill = "white",
    label.size = NA,
    label.padding = unit(0, "cm"),
    hjust = 0,
    nudge_x = 1.5,
    size = 3.2
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "black"),
    axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0.4),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, color = "#f20707", face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9, color = "grey30")
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    expand = c(0, 0, 0.01, 0.01),
    breaks = seq(25, 100, 25)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Penpals",
    subtitle = "Lenin's most frequent letter addressees",
    x = "number of letters"
  )

```
The most common way Lenin started his letters was with the salutation "Dear
Comrade." The most common way he ended his letters was with the close "Yours,
V.U."

It's interesting that "Salut, Lenin" made it into the top 5. Russia and France
had close political ties, and in the 18th and 19th century it was fashionable
for the nobility to converse in French. The class-based language barriers and
trendy use of French feature in Tolstoy's *Anna Karenina* and Chernychevsky's
*What is to be Done?*. Lenin also discusses it in his 
[essay on linguistics](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1950/jun/20.htm):

> There was a time when Russian aristocrats at the tsar's court and in high
society also made a fad of the French language. They prided themselves on the
fact that when they spoke Russian they often lapsed into French, that they could
only speak Russian with a French accent. Does this mean that there was no
Russian language common to the whole people at that time in Russia, that a
language common to the whole people was a fiction, and "class languages" a
reality?
